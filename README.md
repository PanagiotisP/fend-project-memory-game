## Instructions

This is the Memory Game Project for Udacity's Front End Development Nanodegree. 

The memory game is really simple: click any card of the deck to reveal it. Click another card trying to find its match. If the two cards match, then they stay open. If the two cards do not match then they become hidden again. The game ends when all 8 pairs of cards are revealed.

A timer at the top keeps track of the duration of the game, a move-counter counts your moves, while a star rating system keeps track of your performance! Try to beat the game with the least wrong moves to ensure you get those 3 stars!

At any point of the game you can reset it by clicking the reset arrow.
